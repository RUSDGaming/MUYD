Items should have some basic stats.

Using the item more will make you more proficient in it.  I'm not sure if I want
a cap on this rating. So sure you'll be able to one shot the end game rocks but
the speed won't increase or you'll still only be able to hit 1 rock at a time.


Skill // using the item will level up this skill
Damage // how much it hurts monsters
Mining // how much it hurts rocks
Speed // the rate at which you can swing or use the item
  unit is pause between swing in milliseconds
Weight // idk if I'll actually have weight
Encumbrance // how fast you can run or sprint while walking
Energy Cost  // how much energy it cost to use the item.


As well as using the item to level it up you can upgrade it.

When putting numbers into things try not to use super low numbers.

For example when making the first rock, if you want it to take 4 hits to break
with a basic pick give it 40 health and give the pick 10 mining. This makes the
numbers easier to tweak later down the road

I haven't decided if I want to make certain things unbreakable unless you have
a certain level.
