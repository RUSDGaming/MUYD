A good part of the game will be spent in the caves.

There will be several types of caves.

The first type of cave will be a typical cave. When you go into the cave most
of the cave will be blocked by impassible rocks.  You can mine these rocks, the
rocks will have a chance to drop an item based on the type of rock it is.

The caves will have random layouts.  There will be a ladder somewhere in the
cave that will allow you to go deeper. As you go deeper the rocks will get
harder, the enemies will get stronger and the drops will get better.

look at this for finding out how to make each level, I'm thinking each floor
should have a small number of rooms. Each room will have a random amount of
enemies, rocks and drops.
