This game is basically a harvest moon game focused more
on mining and combat than farming.

You start off the game either moving to a new town or become of age  where you
have to start working.. idk needs to be developed.

You find a cave or inherit it or something.

You go into the cave and find some gems or something that you can pick up.

You can sell these to the market.

On the market you can buy basic things like pickaxes and wheel barrows.

Selling raw materials doesn't grant you much. So you either need to find better
materials or process them yourself.

There will be several Machines that you can process materials with. I also
plan to have others that would allow you to modify your character.

You will find different caves and when you get deep enough you'll start pissing
off the local fauna.  You will have to defend your base and your selfish ass
delve deeper into the cave. "They dug too deep and too greedily" or something.

Some deep backstory will appear as you get later into the game That will
eventually require you to ally with either the deep mysterious force that lives 
in the caves or the big corporation that you are selling your stuff too.

I guess the game will "end" when you beat the boss or something.

I feel like the games difficultly will changes based on the total number of
levels that you have dug into.
