Machine
  You would slowly replace parts of your body with machine parts. Eventually you
would replace your entire body with a machine and transfer your soul into it.

Mutation

to become better faster stronger harder.   Things like increased endurance,
ability to see in the dark, acid spit for dissolving rocks.
